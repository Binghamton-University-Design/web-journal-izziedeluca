					<h2>Project 4: Infographic </h2>
					<p><img id=xmas src= "images/info.jpg"></p>
					<p>I created an infographic of how Christmas has been celebrated historically. Christmas is very important to me because I'm a catholic and this time of year inspired me to create this project. I learned a lot about the history so it was very fun to do. I took a whimsical approach to my infographic, mixing hand drawn symbols, typography and historical imagery.

					<h2>Project 3:  Article Illustration</h2>
					<p> Betsey Johnson’s Colorful Malibu Mobile Home is for Sale for $1.95 Million </p>
					<p><img id= home src="images/house.jpg"></p>
					<p> Modern Designer is Bringing Back 1950's Fashion
						<p><img id="lady" src="images/2.png"></p>
						<p> Best Perfumes to Purchase for the 2019 Holiday Season
						<p><img src="images/5.jpg"></p>
						<p> For this project I decided to follow a theme of popular culture. In my first image, I illustrated the house of fashion designer, Betsy Johnson, which she has up for sale in malibu. I was intrigued by the home and how unique it looked. In my second image, I illustrated an article of a fashion designer who was bringing back 50's fashion, I attempted to make a fresh mix of both time periods by involving the fashion as well as a modern day object such as the iphone. For my third image, I would like to get into advertising so I wanted to experiment with a consumerism concept. I illustrated a bottle of perfume as well as accessories with it to demonstrate the scent and so the viewer can visualize how it will be when they purchase it. I wanted to also play with freeform gradients and glass illustration, the last image was very much new territory for me, I look forward to working more with freeform gradients in the future.

					<h2>Project 2:  Icons</h2>
					<p><img id= icon src= "images/icon.png"></p>
					<p>I created icons of things that I enjoy. Throughout all three images, I used a consistent color scheme that could work for all of the objects in order to make them aesthetically cohesive. The items includ a lipstick, a cosmopolitan as well as a purse. I went for a graphic style because I wanted to emulate glamour and posh.

					<h2>Project 1: 
						Avatar</h2>
					<p><img src=av.png></p>
					<p>In this project I created an avatar based on myself, I enjoy the color pink as well as handbags so naturally I gave my avatar such items.
